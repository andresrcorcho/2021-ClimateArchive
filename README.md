# 2021-ClimateArchive

Overview:

    The goal of this project is to give researchers easy access to complex climate data with the climatearchive.org web application as a front end and our software solution as the
    backend to provide access to the data. The website currently visualises the research data in 3D, however quantitative access to the underlying data is needed to improve
    interdisciplinary research. We will provide a solution which filters the database and produces smaller data subsets which could then be downloaded/visualised from the browser.

Stakeholders:

    The typical stakeholders for this project will be researchers, or other people who may be interested in the data,
    who may not be particularly tech savy.

  User Stories :

    A researcher / individual interested in the data, I should be able to select a point on the globe on the already
    provided climate change model in order to extract point data for a selected location and time period
