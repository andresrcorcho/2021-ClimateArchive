# 2021-ClimateArchive

Overview:

    The goal of this project is to give researchers easy access to complex climate data with the climatearchive.org web
    application as a front end and our software solution as the backend to provide access to the data. The website
    currently visualises the research data in 3D, however quantitative access to the underlying data is needed to improve
    interdisciplinary research. We will provide a solution which filters the database and produces smaller data subsets
    which could then be downloaded/visualised from the browser.

Stakeholders:

    The typical stakeholders for this project will be researchers, or other people who may be interested in the data,
    who may not be particularly tech savy.

  User Stories :

    A researcher / individual interested in the data, I should be able to:
        -select a point on the globe on the alreadyprovided climate change model in order to extract point data for a selected location and time period.
        -view and compare graphs generated from comparing these data points.
        -download datasets generated from certain parameters
        -share datasets/graphs generated at specific points with other individuals
    
Note: we are mainly working on our client's private repository to add features to climatearchive.org and on a backend server to provide access to underlying climate data.
